<p><strong>1 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This is our MADGamers Participation game offering for 2012-2013. It is a Post Zombies Apocalypse game where the
    players are Zombies. Everything else is reasonably straightforward. The Aim of the game is for the players to expand
    their pack of six (6) initial zombies to a horde of twelve (12) zombies. This is done by converting survivors to
    zombies by eating them. The game is set in a remote English town in the shires. The Zombie Apocalypse has arrived
    and your Zombies are hungry!</p>
<p><strong>2 Set-up.</strong></p>
<p>Each player gets a group of six (6) zombies, six (6) zombie crystals, a range stick (six (6) inches long) and a
    coloured counter. The Zombie Packs are placed on their start points.</p>
<p>The Games Master will then pick and place survivor counters (One per player at random spots in the village. There can
    never be more blips on the move then there are players). One this is complete the Games Master can then start the
    game proper.</p>
<p><strong>3 Game Sequence</strong></p>
<p>The Games master draws a colour counter from the player bag. This player may now.</p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> Move his zombies (see 6. Move)</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Uncover survivors by running over a survivor counter or checking relevant terrains items (Cars,
    Buildings, Trees, Litter boxes, post boxes, phones boxes, sheds etc.) (See 8. Survivors)</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Can attempt to gain entry to buildings (See 4. Buildings)</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> Eat survivors (see 5. Combat)</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> Influence other Zombies to join his/her pack (see 7. Pack Attack)</p>
<p>A player may move and attack in any sequence they like.</p>
<p>Once each player has had a turn the games master will move the survivors add new survivor counters and check to see
    if any player has gained victory by getting to twelve (12) or more zombies.</p>
<p><strong>4 Buildings</strong></p>
<p>To gain entry to a building a pack must force a door. To force a door the pack must inflict five (5) hits on the
    door. The player rolls one (1) dice per zombie in their pack. For five (5) and six (6) is a hit and is accumulative.
    Once the player gets five (5) hits they can enter the building and the Games Master can draw two (2) survivor
    counters for the building. Once a door is open the door remains open for the duration of the game.</p>
<p><strong>5 Combat</strong></p>
<p>Once the player has uncovered survivors they may attack them. Attacking the survivors has a number of actions
    associated with it. Some survivors get to act first (Rioters, Soldiers, Special Forces). Some survivors attempt to
    confuse the Zombies (Police, Riot Police, Scientists, TV Crew). Check the survivor’s section (see 8. Survivors) for
    details.</p>
<p>The player when he gets to attack may roll a dice for each zombie in his pack. On a result of five (5) or six (6) the
    attack is successful and the survivor may save if they have a save.</p>
<p>For each survivor who may save the Games Masters rolls one dice and on a five (5) or six (6) the survivor is saved.
    If the save fails then the survivor becomes a zombie and is added to the players zombie pack.</p>
<p><strong>6 Move</strong></p>
<p>Zombies may move six (6) inches in a turn. They ignore terrain difficulties but must stop when they get to an item
    they can investigate (Cars, Buildings, Trees, Litter boxes, post boxes, phones boxes, sheds etc.). To enter a
    building the pack must force a door (see 4. Buildings). Otherwise the Games Master draws a (1) Survivor counter for
    the item. If the Pack forces entry into a building the Games Master draws two (2) Survivor Counters for the
    buildings. All zombies in a pack must stay together – splitting a pack will cause a player to lose control over a
    section of the pack.</p>
<p><strong>7 Pack Attack</strong></p>
<p>When a Zombie pack meets another Zombie pack they separate into two packs. This is decided in the following way. Each
    player picks a number range (1,2,3 or 4,5,6) and rolls one (1) dice per zombie in their pack. Every result in that
    players favour joins his pack. If the pack is a neutral pack the Games Master will roll for the neutral pack.</p>
<p><strong>8 Survivors</strong></p>
<p>The attack number represents the dice per model that the Games Master may roll for the attack. On a five (5) or six
    (6) the attack is successful and a Zombie is removed from the players pack. Survivor attacks always go first. If the
    survivors wipe out a zombie pack they will move around after all the players have moved.</p>
