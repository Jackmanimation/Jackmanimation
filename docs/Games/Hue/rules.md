## 1 Introduction

This is an Overview of the game mechanics for the participation game ‚ÄúBattle of Hue‚Äù.
This is based on the Vietnam War ‚Äì Battle of the same name.The basic premise of the game is that six (6) players will control a squad of US soldiers. They will navigate Hue city to achieve an objection. The enemy units will be assigned at
random with six enemy units being in the table at the start of the game. Enemy units will
be controlled in the game by the players (see below).

## 2 Game Mechanics

### 2.1 Set up the game

Each Player is given a squad of US or ARVN soldiers. Each squad is colour coded to match a
token. The players place their squad on the table at the start points.

A scenario is chosen and explained to the players. The list of scenarios is to be decided.
These may include:

- **Get to the LZ** (there is a Huey waiting to take the squad out of Hue) only one
    squad can go.
- **Rescue the POW** ‚Äì A POW is set down and needs to be rescued and returned to a designated spot. There is only one POW.
- **Hold the Bridge** ‚Äì Move to a point on the map and defend it
- **Recon and Report** ‚Äì Move to point on the map and return from it to report on the contents.
- **Defend the Embassy** -   The squads try and defend the embassy from enemy forces. this needs to be done for a number of rounds while the staff destroy files and exfiltrate staff.
- **Defend the CIA compound** ‚Äì The squad try and defend the CIA compound from enemy forces ‚Äì this needs to be done for a number of rounds while the CIA destroy files and exfiltrate staff.

### 2.3 Game loop

A squad token is drawn. If it is your squad colour you may

- Move
- Shoot
- Act
These can be in any order
Once this is done the player may
- Play a card
- Draw a card
A player may only have one card in their hand at a time.

If the NPC token is drawn, then the last player who moved may use the NPC units.
The NPC units may:

- Move
- Shoot
- Act
These can be in any order.

Once all the squad tokens have been drawn. We check for victory conditions. If
these are met, then the game is over. If not we reset the tokens and go again.

#### 2.3.1 Move

A player may move a number of spaces equal to their movement value. The player may move in any direction. The player may not move through walls or other players. The player may not move into a space occupied by an enemy unit.
The player may not move into a space occupied by a friendly unit unless they are in the same squad.

| Movement | Distance | Impact | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Stand Still | 0        | +1 to Shoot OR Act this turn | Represents taking aim, overwatch, or coordination |
| Crawl | 2" |   No penalty to cover or concealment | Slow but stealthy; used to move under fire or in prone position |
| Walk | 4" | Normal Action | Normal movement; used for most actions |
| Run | 6" | -1 to Shoot  | Fast movement; used to cover ground quickly but at a cost |

#### 2.3.2 Shooting

- **Choose Target:** Must be in line of sight and within weapon range.
- **Targets:** Declare who is shooting and at what.
- **Roll Dice:** Roll the number of dice shown for your weapon.
- **Hits:** Hit on 4+: Each roll of 4, 5, or 6 is a hit.
- **Cover:** Hits can be cancelled or reduced by cover (see below).
- **Resolve Hits:** Remaining hits after cover are casualties.
- **Casualties:** Remove models from the board; they are out of the game.

##### 2.3.2.1 Cover Modifiers

| Cover Type | Effect | Hits Cancelled |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| None | No effect | 0 |
| Light Cover (walls, fences, crates) | Ignore 1 hit | 1 |
| Heavy Cover (buildings, sandbags) | Ignore 2 hits | 2 |

Just subtract the number of hits after applying cover.
Remaining hits = casualties.

##### 2.3.2.2 Example

- A Marine with an M16 (1 die) shoots at a VC behind a low wall:
- Rolls: üé≤ = 5 ‚Üí 1 hit
- Cover ignores 1 hit ‚Üí no effect
