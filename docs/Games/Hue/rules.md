# Battle of Huế

## Introduction

This is an Overview of the game mechanics for the participation game “Battle of Hue”.
This is based on the Vietnam War – Battle of the same name.

The basic premise of the game is that six (6) players will control a squad of US soldiers.
They will navigate Hue city to achieve an objection. The enemy units will be assigned at
random with six enemy units being in the table at the start of the game. Enemy units will
be controlled in the game by the players (see below).

## Game Mechanics

Set up the game
Each Player is given a squad of US soldiers. Each squad is colour coded to match a
token. The players place their squad on the table at the start points.

A scenario is chosen and explained to the players. The list of scenarios is to be decided.
These may include:

- **Get to the LZ** (there is a Huey waiting to take the squad out of Hue) only one
    squad can go.

### Game loop

A squad token is drawn. If it is your squad colour you may

- Move
- Shoot
- Act
These can be in any order
Once this is done the player may
- Play a card
- Draw a card
A player may only have one card in their hand at a time.

```
If the NPC token is drawn, then the last player who moved may use the NPC units.
The NPC units may:
```

- Move
- Shoot
- Act
These can be in any order.

```
Once all the squad tokens have been drawn. We check for victory conditions. If
these are met, then the game is over. If not we reset the tokens and go again.
