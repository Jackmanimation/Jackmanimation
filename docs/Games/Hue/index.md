# The Battle of Huế

## January 31st 1968 – March 2nd 1968

The Battle of Huế was one of the most intense and pivotal engagements of the Vietnam War. Fought between January 31 and March 2, 1968, it was part of the larger Tet Offensive a massive, coordinated attack launched by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces across South Vietnam. Huế, a cultural and religious centre, became a battlefield of house-to-house, block-by-block combat.

## Key Dates

- January 31, 1968: Surprise attack launched; most of Huế captured by NVA/VC.
- February 1–10: US Marines and ARVN begin the gruelling counteroffensive.
- February 24: Citadel recaptured after brutal urban combat.
- March 2: Full control of Huế restored to Allied forces.

## Tactical Overview

Unlike most jungle and rural battles in Vietnam, Huế was a rare case of full urban warfare. US Marines, South Vietnamese ARVN forces, and Army units engaged in house-to-house combat, often under sniper fire and with limited artillery support due to the city's historic significance. Fighting was fierce and personal buildings had to be cleared room by room.


## Civilian & Cultural Cost

Thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire or executed by occupying NVA forces. Historic temples, homes, and the ancient Citadel suffered massive damage. Over 100,000 civilians were displaced, and the city's infrastructure was devastated.

## Strategic Significance

Though technically a military victory for the US and South Vietnam, the scale and ferocity of the fighting especially during what was supposed to be a ceasefire shocked the American public. The battle helped shift public opinion against the war and is considered a turning point in US involvement.

## Gaming

This is not a battle that is particularly gamed very often in the Vietnam War genre. It is significantly different from the Jungles normally portrayed and seen for the period. It represents an interesting departure from regular Vietnam war settings.
